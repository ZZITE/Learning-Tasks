        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</em>
        <p>When you purchase something from our website as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal 
        information you give us such as your name, address and email address.
        </p>
        <p>When you browse our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order
        to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
        </p>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products and other updates.</p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 2 - CONSENT</em>
        <p>How do you get my consent?</p>
        <p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order,
            arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
        </p>
        <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent,
            or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
        </p>
        <p style="margin:20px 0 0 0;">How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued
            collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at service@onlyfu.com. 
        </p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 3 - Cookies</em>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.
            We use both session and persistent cookies. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our
            users in the aggregate by analyzing popular areas and products to enhance future experiences on our site.
            Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only the web site that transferred a particular
            cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie. If you do not want information collected through the use of 
            cookies, there are simple procedures in most browsers that allow you to delete existing cookies, to automatically decline
            cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to your computer.
        </p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 4 - Catalog, Newsletters etc.</em>
        <P>If a user wishes to subscribe to our catalog, newsletter, etc., we ask for contact information such as name, street address
            and e-mail address to provide these communications. Because we respect our users' privacy, we provide a way to opt-out of 
            these communications. Please see the choice and opt-out section below.
        </P>
        <P style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily
            suspended for maintenance we might send you an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though you can 
            deactivate your account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
        </P>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 5 - Security</em>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">www.onlyfu.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When our registration/order
            form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number),
            that information is encrypted and is protected with the Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encryption software. 
            While on a secure page, such as our order form, a lock icon appears on the bottom of your Web browser. 
            When you are not on a secure page, no lock icon will appear. In addition, the servers that we store personally 
            identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment under restricted access. However, security systems 
            are not infallible, including encryption systems. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 6 - Supplementation of Information</em>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">In order for www.onlyfu.com to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement
            the information we receive with information from third party sources such as our affiliated websites. For example,
            in order for Ebay.com to enhance our ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information 
            about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our affiliated sites. When a user makes a purchase 
            from any of these companies, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences.
        </p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 7 - Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating</em>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code, phone, e-mail
            or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate
            that user's personally identifiable information provided to us. This can be done by using the unsubscribe feature in our communication.
        </p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 8- Choice/Opt-Out</em>
        <p style="margin:0 0 40px 0;">Users who no longer wish to receive promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe feature in our e-mail.</p>
        <em style="font-weight:bold;">SECTION 9-Changes to This Policy</em>
        <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy, and any of our policies or procedures concerning the treatment of information
            collected through the site, without prior notice. You can determine when this privacy policy was last revised by referring to date
            at the top of this page. Any changes to our privacy policy will become effective upon posting of the revised policy on the Internet,
            accessible through the site. Use of the site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy then in effect.
            We encourage you to periodically review our privacy policy to ensure familiarity with our most current version.
