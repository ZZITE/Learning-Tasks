			<p>According to the Wikipedia data, 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each year. Asia was the leading source of mismanaged plastic waste, 
				with China alone accounting for 2.4 million metric tons. Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. This plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and 
				marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year. Larger plastics (called "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags can clog the digestive tracts of these larger 
				animals when consumed by them and can cause starvation through restricting the movement of food, or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into thinking it is 
				full. Microplastics on the other hand harm smaller marine life. Pelagic plastic pieces in the center of our ocean’s gyres for example outnumber live marine plankton, 
				and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life. A 1994 study of the seabed using trawl nets in the North-Western Mediterranean around the coasts of Spain, 
				France and Italy reported mean concentrations of debris of 1,935 items per square kilometre. Plastic debris accounted for 77%, of which 93% was plastic bags. Therefore, 
				we decided to start and work hard to remove trash and pollutants from then on.</p>
			<p>We shall search for more effective scientific methods to recycling of chemical waste and choose to cooperate with a more outstanding factory. Strive for a life of environmental 
				protection!

			<h4>What's SA8000?</h4>
			<p>SA8000 is a social accountability standard and certificate developed by Social Accountability International (SAI). This organization created this 
				certification to help and protect workers worldwide by providing a standardized guideline to protect the integrity of workers’conditions and wages. SA8000 
				overlaps with Fairtrade certification in factory working conditions, but while Fairtrade is predominantly used for farming, SA8000 is a certification used in 
				factory conditions. Our factories, certified SA8000, use zero forced or child labor, and always provide living wages and safe conditions.
			</p>
			<h4>Why China and not the USA?</h4>
			<p>You may not know it, but a lot of the best manufacturers for high-performance fabrics are located overseas. We know - we looked. The United States has great manufacturers for basic knitwear, but for our premium activewear the only machines up to the challenge were in China. Once we found our SA8000 certified manufacturer, we knew it was a match. Quality is everything to us, and we wanted to make sure we gave you the best product at the best price that you could find.</p>
			<h4>Are your leggings BPA free?</h4>
			<p>Yes, they are. And we understand why you’d want to check, because there is a lot of confusion around what kind of plastic there is floating around (pun very much intended). 
				Plastics that contain BPA are polycarbonates, or the type of plastic specifically used in reusable water bottles. Plastic that used to use BPA was meant to last for a long 
				time, like your old Nalgene from 2004. 
				Our recycled PET is polyethylene terephthalate and is used in single use water bottles and food containers. Not only that, but it has been repeatedly tested over 30 
				years to for its safety. If it’s safe for your sandwich, it’s safe for your legs.</p>
			<!-- 5 -->
			<h1 id="Fet">Fit & Fabric</h1>
			<h4>How high rise is the core legging?</h4>
			<p>The front rise is about 12” from the crotch, which means it should sit above your belly button.
				How do you turn water bottles into leggings?
			</p>
			<p>Wizards.</p>
			<p>Kidding. We take post consumer water bottles, remove the caps and the labels, and shred the bottles into tiny little chips. From there we process 
				those chips into miniscule, very soft fibers that become our yarn. And that yarn becomes our leggings.</p>
			<h4>How compressive are they?</h4>
			<p>The perfect amount. No, seriously. We tested just about every legging out there to find the best blend of spandex to compress your muscles (so they achieve optimum performance), 
				but don’t make you feel tightly bandaged. That way you can wear them to the gym, in the car, on the trails, even out to dinner (you’ll want to dress them up).</p>
			<h4>What is your sizing like? Is it like Nike or lululemon?</h4>
			<p>We want to be consistent. If you’re a small in Nike, you’re a small in Niceline. Check out our size chart to make sure your measurements line up.</p>
			<!-- 6 -->
			<h1 id="donate">How to Donate</h1>
			<p>Please click the "REDEEM VIA EMAIL" at our home page, and there are 4 steps to complete your donation to the Red Cross.Meanwhile,we will check your related 
				information and send you a piece of our high-quality environmentally-friendly leggings for free.</p>
			<h4>Notes:</h4>
			<p>①The only way to know about the process of donation and free leggings is your email.So as I say, notice that don't blacklist our accounts careless,check 
				your dustbin at times and make sure you can receive our email.</p>
			<p>②You will receive an email from Niceline after your payment. There will be a link in this email.You should keep this email and confirm by this link after you receive 
				the leggings.And then,we shall arrange the donation. </p>
			<p>③Donation amount must be above USD$10 every time.Therefore,Niceline will keep your USD$0.99 temporarily until the contributions have been accumulated 
				to USD$10 and then donate to the Red Cross.</p>
			<p>④After donating,you can receive our related email or find your name in the donation lists on our site. </p>

			<h1 id="shipping">Shipping</h1>
			<h4>Why aren’t my leggings shipped out immediately after I donate?</h4>
			<p>This is a pre-order. What that means is that every single pair of our leggings is made-to-order. To give you leggings for the cost of shipping we couldn’t have extra 
				stock left over, so we decided to make them as the orders came in to make sure everyone could get them and we could guarantee that we’d have the capital to launch our 
				full line. When we do launch our full line early next year, we will have pre-made stock like normal e-commerce and your product will ship out immediately.</p>
			<h4>I was wondering, how can I track the shipment?</h4>
			<p>You bet. We hate being in the dark, too. As soon as your leggings ship from our factory in China we will provide a tracking number for you via email.</p>
			<h4>Why do you charge shipping USD$19?</h4>
			<p>Shipping is definitely based on location, but a few folks did luck out and pay less. Prior to launch, we were running some tests to make sure the site was functioning 
				properly — this was before we had finalized our actual shipping and handling costs (though our estimates were in the same ballpark).</p>
			<p>Shipping internationally is more expensive than shipping to the US because we are working directly with Standard Express, and the bulk of our shipments are headed 
				to the US. We will of course continue to look for cheaper options as we move forward with our full line. We are so excited to keep improving, and would love to answer 
				any more of your questions.</p>
			<p>There’s no way shipping is actually <em style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">USD$19.</em></p>
			<p>It is! We promise. </p>
			<p>More significant,all these shall support our donation activity to go farther!</p>
			<h4>Why are you only shipping to a few countries?</h4>
			<p>As much as we’d like to, right now we can surely ship to Canada, the United Kingdom, the US, and Australia.If you are in other countries,you can 
			contact with our customer service.</p>
			<p>Because we want to do things in the best way, we couldn’t settle for less. We are working right now to find a new method to offer our leggings to people all 
				over the globe, and as soon as we do we will let you know (so follow us on Facebook and Instagram)!</p>
			<h4>How much will the leggings be after this donation activity?</h4>
			<p>We believe that living well and looking great should be easy for everyone, and are committed to having much lower prices than our competitors. And we do this while 
				not sacrificing quality, human rights, or the environment. </p>
			<p>Our Core Legging will retail for $70 when our full line launches, and we can’t wait for you to get more.</p>
			<!-- 8 -->
			<h1 id="ORDER">Returns &Exchanges</h1>
			<p>When we launch our full line, our return policy will be much more relaxed. For our pre-launch, since we are absorbing the cost of the leggings, so all 
				requests for exchanges or returns need to email to service@niceline.com where we will review your claim and let you know what you can do. 
				If you decide to return,you should ship it to us at your own expense,and we will RETURN the total money,including the loving donation and s
				hipping charge you have payed.Your money wouldn’t continue to donate to the Red Cross.If you decide to exchange leggings,you should ship it to us at 
				your own expense,pay for the freight to the new one and we will donate your $0.99 when you receive the new one and also confirm the link in our email before. </p>
			<p>Under other circumstance,please contact with our customer service via service@niceline.com.</p>

			<h1 id="Fabric">Our Fabric</h1>
			<h4>Fiber is part of a healthy fashion diet.</h4>
			<p>If you look at the label inside your leggings it will usually say some version of this:85% percent polyester 15% spandex/lycra/elastane or</p>
			<p>85% percent nylon 15% spandex/lycra/elastane </p>
			<p>Let’s start with the fiber that gives leggings stretch. That 15% spandex/lycra/elastane is really just a yarn that stretches and is a stronger 
				and longer lasting material than rubber. People call it a bunch of different things, but at the core all that stretchy yarn does the same thing - it 
				helps your leggings stretch and bounce back to its original form. Another component that makes up the bulk of your leggings is either Nylon or Polyester. 
				We want you to get to know those more, so read on!
			</p>	
			<h4>First, Nylon</h4>
			<p>Nylon, aka polyamide, is a strong fiber known for its silky-soft and lustrous feel. It has been around since 1935 and has many applications outside of 
				clothing including everyday plastic products like fishnets. 
			</p>	
			<p>The main benefit of nylon in clothing is that it is super strong, wicks away moisture like a champ, and stretches. </p>
			<p>The negative impacts of nylon are that it’s known to pill easily (so annoying), and retains more moisture than polyester, even though it is naturally hydrophobic.</p>
			<h4>We love Polyester</h4>
			<p>Polyester, aka PET, is also a strong fiber with advances in manufacturing; it now rivals nylon in softness. The fiber is not as strong as nylon, but has better 
				performance in many ways. Polyester resists pilling more than nylon, and outdoes nylon in moisture wicking and quick-drying. Since polyester doesn’t retain water, 
				it is colorfast and does not fade over time like nylon. 
			</p>
			<p>Across most performance and activewear, you’ll find a combination of these fibers. Some brands introduce cotton yarn into the mix, and fibers like modal or rayon to 
				achieve a different drape or feel, but what makes performance wear perform are nylon, polyester, and spandex yarns knitted together to make fabric.
			</p>
			<h4>The shady business of Lycra.</h4>
			<p>The brand Lycra is used fairly often in stretch fabrics and is a brand that’s owned by Koch Industries, the conglomerate owned by the billionaire Koch brothers who are 
				activists in DENYING climate change, and may or may not be the puppet masters behind a lot of lobbyists. Yikes. We’re staying far away from that mess.
			</p>
			<h1>What’s our knit?</h1>
			<p>In stretch fabrics, there are different types of knitting techniques. In general, they end up with what you know as a jersey fabric. Most brands tend to use single jersey 
				around 200 gsm (grams per square meter) to 320 gsm. Leggings from Lululemon or Nike range from lighter weight 200gsm all the way up to 320 gsm (for heavier weight 
				everyday leggings) and they vary depending on different activities. So the Luon fabric is on the heavier end, meant for low sweat activities, versus luxtreme, which is a 
				lighter fabric meant for high-sweat activities. 
			</p>
			<p>Single jersey fabric is the most common type of knitwear and is used most often in everything from t-shirts to leggings. Single jersey has two sides, one side the face 
				and the other the back. The face is what you see on the outside of the garment; often smooth and soft, while the backside is dull and rough. If you flip a t-shirt inside 
				out and look carefully, you see and feel the difference.
			</p>
			<h4>What goes into our Niceline leggings?</h4>
			<p>We spent months researching and looking at the mills that Lululemon and other luxury activewear companies use. We could have easily bought and used the same fabrics as 
				everyone else and just charged less, but we decided there had to be a way to do this right, have accessible prices, and sleep well at night. So we developed our own custom 
				fabric, using an exact blend of yarns at the exact weight we wanted. 
			</p>
			<h5 style="margin:20px 0 10px 0;">What we ended up with is:</h5>
			<h5>79% recycled micro polyester</h5>
			<h5>21% spandex</h5>
			<h5>260 gsm</h5>
			<h4>Tite Tech</h4>
			<p>Our polyester yarn is made from 100% recycled post-consumer water bottles. Yes, you read that right. Those $100 leggings that you’ve bought from other brands are now 
				eco-friendly and half the cost. 
			</p>
			<p>The micro-denier polyester yarn has the best moisture wicking capabilities. It regulates your body temperature whether you’re working out or not. It’s meant to keep you 
				cool in hot temperatures, and comfortably warm in cold situations. 
			</p>
			<p>Using 20% spandex gives the perfect amount of compression for being active, and for everyday wear. The amount of compression in our leggings helps your muscles perform 
				in your high impact activities, but it’s not so compressive that they become uncomfortable when you’re lounging. 
			</p>
			<p>Tite Tech is an incredible new fabric that is just as soft and smooth on the inside of the fabric as it is on the outside. It also prevents pilling and is completely opaque.</p>

			<h1 id="Beyond">Beyond Recycling</h1>
			<h4>What goes into our stuff is as good as how it looks.</h4>
			<p>In 2014, 48.8% of all clothing imported into the US was made of synthetic materials and yarns, higher than at any other time in the last 20 years. Why? 
				Well, because crude oil prices have gone down, while demand for active and performance fabrics has gone up. So how do we fix this? We use only recycled materials or RPET.
			</p>
			<h4>Some benefits of RPET</h4>
			<h5 style="margin:30px 0 10px 0;">85% less energy than regular polyester</h5>
			<h5>65% less sulfur dioxide than regular polyester</h5>
			<h5>90% less water usage than regular polyester</h5>
			<h5>RPET fabric has a 50% lower carbon footprint than the organic cotton</h5>
			<h5>RPET polyester fabric has almost a 90% lower carbon footprint than nylon</h5>
			<h4>Certified Bluesign®</h4>
			<p>Niceline fabric is so proud to be Bluesign® certified. All manufacturers who become partners with Bluesign® agree to ensure high environmental safety and 
				performance in five areas: consumer safety (everything in our leggings is super safe), resource productivity, water emissions, air emissions, and workplace 
				health and safety. Guess what? As a partner, we’ve proven that we reach those standards, will continue to send reports, and promise to open our facilities up 
				to on-site audits. Learn more about Bluesign®.

			<h1 id="Factory">Our SA8000 Factory</h1>
			<h4>Humane factory conditions and wages for all.</h4>
			<p>It’s time to make a stand. It is inexcusable when brands have underage workers, unsafe conditions, or underpaid employees in their factories. Thankfully, 
				we found a partner that has already taken a stand by insisting on being a SA8000 certified factory in the country of China. What this means is that the factory 
				needs to be audited and comply with these requirements:
